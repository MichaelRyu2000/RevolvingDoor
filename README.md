# RevolvingDoor

Implementation of app where user can choose multiple pictures from their local file system using Photo Picker and can then use those photos as wallpapers on a timer basis.

The current implementation focuses on using Foreground Services, but the other branches also displays my attempts (and failure to attempt) at using other methods to achive the same functionality.
